## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

## Known Bugs
After the user enters the "My List" tab and returns to the main tab, the filter title and options will be arranged across two rows instead of one.

Similarly, the cards of hotels will be listed in a single column rather than four columns after the user enters the "My List" tab and returns to the main tab.
